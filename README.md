# My test tasks
### Test Tasks that I was proposed to complete for interviews.

- Implement a classification in the **TensorFlow** framework for the attached dataset (*TensorFlow Speech Recognition Challenge*). The dataset includes a set of recorded short commands or some random noise.
- Develop an application for text scrapping from proposed website using **Scrapper**, write all data into `CSV` file. [Repo](https://github.com/vagi/webscrapping-with-scrapy)
